What is the order of Constructor execution for the following inheritance hierarchy:
        Base
          |
        Derived1
          |
        Derived2

Derived2 obj = new Derived2();
Which Constructor(s) will be executed and what is their order?

Ans: If we are not using super keyword, then it will only run the constructor of Derived2 class
     Otherwise, if we have used super while defining the constructors of the classes Derived1 and Derived2 then all the
     three Constructors will be invoked in the order -> Base, Derived1 and Derived2
